        <p>A main dish is the primary dish of a meal, around which the meal is built. Usually it involves a protein such as meat or fish, or it can be something like a casserole with protein in it. It is often accompanied by one or more side dishes. In recent times, in my opinion, the main dish has often become the “only” dish at dinner. I do think this is part of the weight problem in our country. People are too busy to cook and if they get the protein part done, they are happy. This has led to the lack of side dishes of healthy vegetables. People tend to fill up on the protein and forget the vegetables. My website is heavy on Main Dish recipes because I find it’s easy to add a simple vegetable or salad to complete the meal. More often than not, people are searching, “What to fix for dinner.” Most of the main dishes on my website can be portioned out and frozen. The leftovers are often great for lunch.</p>

            <h2>Honey Garlic Chicken Breast</h2>
            <p>Honey Garlic Chicken is an epic 12 minute chicken breast recipe with a magic 5 ingredient Honey Garlic Sauce! This is a terrific back pocket quick dinner idea for busy nights that’s made with pantry staples. It’s quite amazing how so few ingredients can transform into such a tasty sauce for chicken!</p>
            <p>This sauce for chicken breast is a variation of my Honey Garlic Salmon which has been popular with readers for many years. If I were ever to do a summary of my top 5 Most Used Sauces, Honey Garlic Sauce would probably be right at the top of the list. I love it because it requires so few ingredients that are pantry staples, and when simmered with a seared protein in a skillet so it becomes all bubbly and syrupy…. oh WOW.</p>
